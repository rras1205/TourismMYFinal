## Project Overview

TourismMY is an Android application prototype designed to explore how a single platform could connect tourists, local service providers, and administrators within the Malaysian tourism ecosystem.

The app focuses on:
- Role-based user experiences (Tourist, Business, Admin)
- Firebase-backed authentication and data storage
- A rule-based itinerary generator to assist travel planning
- Basic safety and localization features

## User Roles

- **Tourist**  
  Browse attractions and services, generate itineraries, manage bookings, and access safety features.

- **Business Owner**  
  Create and manage service listings, view incoming bookings, and update availability.

- **Administrator**  
  Monitor platform data, view system metrics, and moderate listings.
